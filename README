Test case for GHC #15524

```
> ./bad-all
...

real	2m24.222s
user	2m23.960s
sys	0m0.205s
> ./good-no-lib
...
real	0m11.752s
user	0m11.536s
sys	0m0.138s

> ./good-dynamic
...
real	0m0.342s
user	0m0.194s
sys	0m0.102s

> ./good-no-split
...

real	0m0.432s
user	0m0.292s
sys	0m0.093s

> ./good-no-lib-no-split
...
real	0m0.432s
user	0m0.277s
sys	0m0.112s

```

As far as I can tell the problem is a combination of three things.

1. Static linking the executable
2. The cabal flag `--enable-library-for-ghci`
3. Enabling `--split-sections`

* `bad-all` is with (1) (2) and (3)
* `good-no-lib` is (1) and (3)
* `good-no-split` is (1) and (2)
* `good-no-lib-no-split` is just (1)
* `good-dynamic` is (2) and (3)
